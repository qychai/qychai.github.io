Welcome to my site! 

My research interests include labor economics and applied microeconomics. My current research focuses on intergenerational mobility, migration, gender, technology adoption, and international aid.

I received my PhD in Economics from Boston University in 2025. In Fall 2025, I will join NYU Shanghai as an Assistant Professor in Economics.
