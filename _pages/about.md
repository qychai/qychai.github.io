Welcome to my site! 

I am an Assistant Professor in Economics at NYU Shanghai. I received my Ph.D. in economics from Boston University in 2025.

My research interests include labor economics and applied microeconomics. My current research focuses on intergenerational mobility, migration, gender, technology adoption, and international aid.
