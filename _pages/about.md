Welcome to my site! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Boston University.

My research interests are labor and development economics, with a focus on intergenerational mobility, migration, real estate, technology adoption, gender, and international aid.

In Fall 2025, I will join NYU Shanghai as an Assistant Professor in Economics.
