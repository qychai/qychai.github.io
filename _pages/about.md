Welcome to my site! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Boston University.

My research interests are labor and development economics, with a focus on intergenerational mobility, migration, real estate, technology adoption, gender, and international aid.

I will be on the 2024-25 job market. 

Please find my [CV here](https://).
